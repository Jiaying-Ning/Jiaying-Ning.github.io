I realized my interest for public health as I was taking courses about neuroscience and mental health as an undergraduate student. As my understanding for mental health problems grew, I saw the urgency in taking action to help those in need. 

I graduated from the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) with a bachelor degree in Statistics and Psychology in 2020. I am currently studying for my master of biostatistics program in [Columbia University](https://www.mailman.columbia.edu/become-student/departments/biostatistics)

My resume is available [here](images/Resume.pdf).
